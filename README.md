# In/Out Board
This project is an in-out board created for [Frderick Water](https://www.frederickwater.com). It was created using JavaScript and React. I'm leaving all of the autogenerated Create React App content below and adding this for more details.

## Running the app
The app runs using `npm run build` and moving the contents of the build folder to your webserver of choice (such as /var/www/html if you're running Apache2). If you want to make changes and test them, you can run `npm start` and it will run a version of the app on Port 3000 that you can edit and test in a live environment.

## API
The app requires an API against which to make calls. I wrote the API in node.js, and it connects to a MSSQL server (this isn't a requirement by any means, but it's what we had, and while I'm more comfortable with MariaDB I didn't want to set up a new database server for such a small application).  
As written, my API contains credentials, which is why it is not included here. Maybe I will clean it up. As it currently stands, there are two API calls, a GET call to grab all of the users from the database and a POST call to change the status of an individual user.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
